# CS-370-Final-Project

The purpose of this project was to design an intelligent agent representing an NPC pirate character in a treasure hunt game. The pirate must navigate the virtual world, which consists of different pathways and obstacles, in order to find the treasure. The pirate's goal is to find the treasure before the human player, making this a common pathfinding problem. I was given code that provided the agent with actions it could take to navigate the enviornment, as well as code for creating the environment itself. I needed to create a learning algorithm code for the intelligent agent so that it could learn how to navigate the enviornment on its own.
