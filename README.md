# CS-370-Final-Project

The purpose of this project was to design an intelligent agent representing an NPC pirate character in a treasure hunt game. The pirate must navigate the virtual world, which consists of different pathways and obstacles, in order to find the treasure. The pirate's goal is to find the treasure before the human player, making this a common pathfinding problem. I was given code that provided the agent with actions it could take to navigate the enviornment, as well as code for creating the environment itself. I needed to create a learning algorithm code for the intelligent agent so that it could learn how to navigate the enviornment on its own. 

### What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
I believe that problem solving is at the heart of what computer scientists do. What makes computer scientists unique is their ability to solve problems more efficiently by utilizing technology and the power of programming. This type of work matters because new technology is at the forefront of human evolution. While computers as a technology are relatively new, creating technology to help make doing everyday tasks more efficient is a practice as old as the human species itself. The term "computer scientist" is more relevent today because computers are a regular part of life, but the profession is really another term from "problem solver."


### How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
I approach a problem as a computer scientist by first looking at all of the variables. What is it that I am trying to achieve and what tools do I have at my disposal to accomplish the task. Then I break the problem down into smaller pieces and tasks because in order to solve one big problem, you often need to solve many other problems first. This makes the process of solving the problem less intimidating, and more importantly, it ensures that the final solution to the problem is thorough.


### What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
My ethical reposnsibilities to the end user and the organization are to balance the solution with the interests of the end user and the organization. Any product that I help to create should protect the rights and privacy of the end user. The organization should have a shared interesdt in this goal as well, but they may need to be better informed about the potential violations to a common code of ethics in computer science that might occur as a result of what they want to accomplish. It's important to realize that not everyone understands what goes into creating some technologies, so it's up to computer scientists to be that gatekeeper.
